                <h2>Valkyrie, Gibraltar, Ash</h2>
                <div class=read-more-container>
                    <div class="content-container-text">
                        <p> This team composition has become common in the competitive meta for good reason. All three
                            characters
                            provide excellent utility on their own, while their abilities combine to create superior
                            movement,
                            survivability, and damage output.
                        </p>
                        <span class="read-more-text">
                            <p> To start, Gibraltar remains the best defensive character in the game, making him almost
                                a mandatory
                                pick if players want an easier time in ranked lobbies. He can poke for free with his
                                passive, the
                                Gun Shield, reducing the need for healing items and making it easier to level his Evo
                                Shield.
                                Gibraltar’s tactical, his Dome Shield, provides a full reset for a squad under pressure,
                                allowing
                                his team to fully heal or get a revive. It doubles as a repositioning tool when thrown
                                and can
                                instantaneously fix disastrous pushes or retreats. Finally, Gibraltar’s versatile
                                ultimate can be
                                used to defend from enemy pushes, as a finisher on weakened opponents, or as a zoning
                                tool. </p>

                            <p>Valkyrie is the scout of this composition, used to gather information and make quick
                                rotations. In a
                                fight, her missiles can harass players behind cover, and her VTOL jets allow her to take
                                advantage
                                of angles most other legends can’t reach. That passive alone is better than the entire
                                kit of some
                                other legends. As a recon character, she also can scan beacons, revealing the next ring,
                                which is
                                incredibly valuable. But the strongest part of her kit for this composition is her ult.
                                It works as
                                a get-out-of-jail-free card in a variety of different scenarios. Once in the air,
                                Valkyrie continues
                                to gain information on the position of other squads,
                                allowing the team to land in a safe place. Lastly, Gibraltar’s bubble combines perfectly
                                with Valk’s
                                ultimate, allowing teams to drop a bubble in the middle of an open field if they need to
                                and safely
                                leave an entire area of the map for a superior position.</p>

                <h2>Revenant, Octane, Bloodhound</h2>
                <div class="read-more-container">
                    <div class="content-container-text">
                        <p> This setup is strong in ranked play if you’re looking for a more aggressive composition that
                            can rack
                            up kill points, rotate quickly, and overwhelm unsuspecting enemies. It may have gone out of
                            fashion,
                            but it still works well in your everyday lobbies, particularly in Gold or Platinum. While it
                            may
                            lack in survivability, it shines on offense.
                        </p>
                        <span class="read-more-text">
                            The team composition is built around the controversial Revenant/Octane combination,
                            commonly referred
                            to as RevTane, where Revenant’s Death Totem ultimate is used in conjunction with
                            Octane’s Jump Pad.
                            Players activate Revenant’s ultimate and then immediately take Octane’s Jump Pad to push
                            into a
                            fight, typically looking for at least one quick knockdown on the opposing team or an
                            easy third
                            party. Revenant can also look to silence the abilities of the defenders with his
                            tactical, leaving
                            them unable to adequately reset defenses or escape. </p>
                            This strategy has had vocal detractors since the combination became popular. Many players
                            believe
                            it’s a cheap tactic, or that after Revenant’s ultimate was changed to be more obvious,
                            it’s no
                            longer effective. But Revenant pushes still work well in Platinum lobbies, and can
                            easily overwhelm
                            players in Gold.

                            Since this strategy is a bit of a niche and works on its own as a duo, several other
                            legends can
                            serve as a viable third character in this composition. It’s a matter of preference. A
                            quick Wraith
                            portal can make failed RevTane pushes safer from easy retaliation. Ash or Valkyrie can
                            add even more
                            aggression to the mix. Gibby adds a lot of defensive value to a composition that could
                            use it. Even
                            Lifeline’s tactical, her healing drone, can help RevTane teams heal up after being sent
                            back to the
                            Death Totem.

                        <p> This is an effective and well-balanced team composition that’s proven itself time and again.
                            Bloodhound offers scanning, Octane provides fast movement and rotations, and Gibraltar is
                            the team’s
                            defensive core. This combination can also be played with variations on the same idea.
                        </p>
                        <span class="read-more-text">
                            While Seer is
                            no longer the powerhouse he was when the character was released, he’s still deadly in the
                            hands of a
                            decent player, and his scanning abilities make it easy for him to replace Bloodhound.
                            Wraith’s
                            portal provides a more deliberate, less aggressive alternative to Octane’s jump pad.
                            Aggressive
                            squads who feel comfortable without Gibraltar’s bubble shield can even work Caustic into
                            this setup.Octane’s Jump Pad got a small nerf recently, but his movement is still more
                            forgiving than Wraith,
                            whose less frequent portal ultimate requires a certain amount of finesse. Similarly,
                            Bloodhound is
                            easier to use than Seer right now, and Bloodhound’s scan combines more effectively with
                            Octane’s
                            Jump Pad. But variations on this theme will continue to perform well in lobbies. It’s a
                            fundamentally sound team.
