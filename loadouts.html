                    <div class="content-container-text">
                        <p> The VK-47 Flatline, also called Flatline, has been around since the release of Apex Legends,
                            and is still one of the best assault rifles.It gives you mid-range superiority while not
                            requiring as many attachments as the other assault rifles. However, it also kills players in
                            close proximity, making it one of the most versatile guns in the ring.
                        </p>
                        <span class="read-more-text">
                            <p> Respawn has reduced its damage from 19 to 18 per bullet. With the new ground loot
                                changes, it does not spawn on the ground anymore. Flatlines can now only be accessed via
                                crafting stations in Defiance. </p>

                            <p>Despite all these changes, Flatline would still be a viable option to have as a primary
                                weapon in Season 12 of Apex Legends.

                                With the Flatline as the primary weapon, the Peacekeeper is a reliable secondary choice.
                                With its high DPS (damage per second), it can hit enemies hard and inflict significant
                                damage.

                                The slow fire rate and long reload times might get on your nerves, but a quick switch
                                from Flatline to Peacekeeper can make enemies touch the ground in seconds.</p>

                <h2>Rampage and Mastiff</h2>
                <div class="read-more-container">
                    <div class="content-container-text">
                        <p> The hard-hitting Rampage introduced in Season 10 can melt enemies at mid to long-range and
                            deal consistent damage.

                            This LMG has a slow fire rate as an automatic weapon, and a low DPS, so close-combat fights
                            can get tough if the weapon is not revved up.
                        </p>
                        <span class="read-more-text">
                            <p>However, using this gun with the Mastiff is makes for a balanced loadout in the game. The
                                Mastiff is a combat shotgun with a consistent amount of close-range damage and a good
                                fire
                                rate. It covers the areas where Rampage lacks, and is the perfect secondary.</p>
                            <p>The 2xHCOG "Bruiser" is the most ideal scope for the rampage as it compensates for the
                                recoil well and gives you decent range. The mastiff on the other hand only requires a
                                shotgun bolt and perhaps a digi if you could pick it up.</p>

                <h2>R-99 and Triple Take</h2>
                <div class="read-more-container">
                    <div class="content-container-text">
                        <p> The R-99 is feared and coveted by a majority of Apex Legends players, rightly so as the
                            fastest-firing gun in the game. This quick and deadly SMG is capable of tearing apart a full
                            armoured opponent in less than a second, provided you hit your shots.
                        </p>
                        <span class="read-more-text">
                            <p>Despite its nerf, the Triple Take is still one of the best marksman rifles to use in Apex
                                Legends.

                                Respawn removed the projectile growth from bullets and reduced damage from 23 to 21 per
                                bullet. However, Triple Take can still be used as a primary marksman rifle in the game.
                            </p>
                            <p>With full attachments, the R-99 can evaporate enemies at close to mid-range. It utilizes
                                light ammo that is easily available on the ground. The horizontal shot fire line and low
                                bullet spread make the Triple Take a good hipfire option. So using it with R-99 gives
                                this combo a huge boost and makes it a fun loadout to have.</p>
